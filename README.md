# HCI-Design
In this project, we worked to design an online sports equipment store. Using several stages, starting from PACT analysis, we created a final, fully functional prototype of high value .
1. First part
My system for an e-store for sports equipment is briefly described. The description contains the 
information about what kind of store it is and for whom it is intended.
A PACT analysis has been done for the system. When making
the analysis is aimed at the characteristics of the elements
defined in PACT. For the realization of
the task analysis is done following it
the theoretical part specified in the course material "Human-Computer Interaction Design". For a 
description of
the users of the system are concentrated on the different roles
that users have at work, but also on the features
which are significant for this type of interactive system. Context analysis is done by determining in 
what physical, social environment the system would be used and for example what organizational 
issues would be significant (eg
credit card payment may be time consuming
limited). When analyzing the technology, it is taken into account what you need for the functionality 
of the system.
Note: The narrative avoids describing the final product because we are still in the analysis phase of 
the product idea and you have not even
determination of user requirements.
2.Second part 
Content of a (semi)structured interview that would they interviewed the users (buyers and sellers).
The interviews helped to determine the types of users and how the activities for the task are 
realized. For each question has an explanation that you want to find out from the answers, that is, 
why you are asking it a question. The questions are selected based on the PACT analysis and
knowledge of similar systems.
Two similar systems that I researched are listed and what inspired me to design this system.
There is a link to the reviewed products and at least two images for each system.
Two stories are written assuming I am the user being interviewed for the basic tasks of this one
system (one each for the buying and selling processes).
A conceptual scenario has been defined for the basic ones tasks of this system (buying and selling).
Personas that will describe them are defined the most characteristic types of users of this system
(one seller and one average buyer).
3.Third part 
In this section, a task in the system with which they are presented is presented realizes the basic 
functionality. It is described the interaction of smoke to buy a product in the system. The task is 
described by a storyboard containing a sufficient number representative images of the system 
screens and a description of the flow of performance of the task. When describing the course of task 
execution the order of the screens is defined and there is enough text for explanation of the activity 
itself. Interactive version of the prototype The interactive prototype enables the simulation of user 
interaction with the system remotely. The interactivity includes displaying system screens and 
transitioning from one to another screen during the realization of the tasks. The minimum 
requirement for the prototype is yes the two basic tasks are realized, the complete process of 
purchasing the product and the process of placing products for sale in the shop. The number of 
different screens for each task and their organization results from the previous stages of the process 
of designing as well as the purpose of the store itself. The prototype is placed in a space that is public
available or there will be an opportunity to download the prototype. The prototype was made using
on the Figma tool (https://www.figma.com/).
4.Fourth part
In order to implement the evaluation process with a cognitive walk, we created the fourth part
Description of what the purpose of the system is, what are its features functionalities, for whom it is 
intended, the technology it will be on implemented. All the information needed for the evaluator can 
"put on your user's shoes"
Interaction flow for the two basic activities – shopping and filling the store. This section contains a 
sufficient number of representative images of the system's screens and a description of the 
implementation steps of the activity. In the description the sequence of the execution of the task is 
defined on the screens. They are the basis used the story boards from the previous ones home, the 
specific scenarios for the tasks, however, have been added to them sufficient detail to assist
colleagues in evaluating thе system.
5.Fifth part // will be uploaded soon 
A high-fidelity prototype is being made this system. A tool was used that made it possible to create a 
prototype with high fidelity. For example Python Django. The prototype will also be hosted publicly
available . A high-fidelity prototype is required to enable system functionality at the user interface 
level. All data and information on the screens will be real. In this case it is not enough to just click on 
the screen and be done transferred to a new page of the system. It is necessary to enable us to enter 
the necessary information and then the system reacts accordingly on the same. We are working on 
the completeness of the system and adherence to the principles of designing usable systems.
